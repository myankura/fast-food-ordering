You need to write code to represent the process of ordering food at a fast food joint. Your restaurant is Bob's Burgers, and you have some starter code below. The object will have two behaviors that you must define.

1. The object should have a property named orders that is an array. You will need to define this.
2. Define a function to represent the behavior of placing an order. It should accept one argument named meal. This argument will be an object. There is starter code provided.
3. Define a function to represent the behavior of getting all orders. It should return the order property (hint: this). You will need to define this.
4. Each meal object should have three properties: sandwichType, fries (true or false), and drinkSize.
